Project Summary â€“ Recipe Website (The Odin Project)

Updated: 07/05/2025

This is my first mini project from The Odin Project: a simple recipe website featuring a few tested Instant Pot recipes.

By the end of this project, I will have gained hands-on experience with the full workflow of web development, including:

- Creating a new repository on GitHub and cloning it to my local machine

- Making meaningful commits using Git as I work through the project

- Building the basic structure of a website using only the command line and VS Code

- Writing clean and properly formatted HTML from scratch, including links, images, lists, and semantic HTML markup

This project not only strengthens my understanding of HTML and Git but also demonstrates my ability to follow development conventions and organize a simple static site from the ground up.
