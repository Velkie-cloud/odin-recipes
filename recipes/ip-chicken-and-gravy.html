                        <li>aluminum foil</li>
                        <li>1 cup water</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><h3>Optional</h3></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup chicken stock (instead of water)</li>
                        <li>¾ teaspoon paprika</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon thyme</li>
                        <li>⅛ teaspoon sage</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Make the seasoning</b><p>In a small bowl, combine salt, (paprika, thyme, sage) pepper, and garlic powder.</p></li>
                <li><b>Season the chicken</b><p>Sprinkle the chicken breasts evenly with the seasoning mixture, rubbing it into both sides.</p></li>
                <li><b>Sear the chicken</b><p>Set the Instant Pot to Sauté mode on high heat. Add olive oil and sear the chicken breasts for about 2 minutes per side, until browned.(Tip: You can also do this in a frying pan to avoid scraping up any brown bits later.)</p></li>
                <li><b>Pressure cook</b><p>Add water or chicken stock to the pot. Place a trivet inside and arrange the chicken breasts on top. Lock the lid and set the Instant Pot to High Pressure for 5 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><b>Natural release</b><p>When the cooking time is up, allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick-release any remaining pressure. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.</p></li>
                <li><b>Make the gravy</b><p>In a small bowl, mix water with cornstarch and stir until fully dissolved. Turn the Instant Pot to Sauté mode again and stir the cornstarch mixture into the liquid in the pot. Cook on medium heat until the gravy thickens. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p></li>
                <li><b>Serve</b><p>Spoon the gravy over the chicken breasts and serve hot — perfect with mashed potatoes, rice, or steamed vegetables.</p></li>
