        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Marinate the ribs</b><p>Place short ribs in a bowl, pour red wine over to cover, and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.</p></li>
                <li><b>Prep the ribs</b><p>Remove ribs from marinade (reserve the liquid). Pat dry, season with salt and pepper, and coat one side lightly with flour.</p></li>
                <li><b>Sear the ribs</b><p>Set Instant Pot to Sauté. Melt butter and oil. Brown ribs (floured side down) in batches, about 8 minutes total. Set aside.</p></li>
                <li><b>Sauté aromatics</b><p>Add onion, carrots, garlic, and rosemary. Cook for 5 minutes, scraping up browned bits.</p></li>
                <li><b>Reduce wine</b><p>Add reserved marinade. Simmer until reduced by half (about 10 minutes).</p></li>
                <li><b>Pressure cook</b><p>Return ribs to pot and add chicken stock. Pressure cook on high for 35 minutes. Let naturally release for 10 minutes, then quick release.</p></li>
                <li><b>Finish the sauce</b><p>Transfer ribs to a plate and cover. Simmer sauce for 5 minutes. Stir in cornstarch slurry and cook 3 minutes until thickened. Strain if desired.</p></li>
                <li><b>Serve</b><p>Pour sauce over ribs and serve hot.</p></li>
